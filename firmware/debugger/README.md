# Drone Firmware Debugger

## General
The debugger provides a GUI for showing internal drone data useful for debugging. If there are changes to what data is beign output from the drone to the debugger or data being shown by the debugger, changes must take place in both places. Look in the firmware to find the corresponding debugger file. There is a provided params file, useful for log output paths.
